YouTube Audio & Video Extractor CHANGELOG
=======================================

Version: 1.18
Date: 12.01.2026
---------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES & IMPROVEMENTS:
* Added -mp3fast option: Allows for quick extraction to 128kbps CBR MP3 format.
* UI Stability (Static Interface): Modified progress handlers to update status lines in-place using carriage returns (\r) and ANSI escape codes (\033[K). This prevents the terminal from scrolling excessively during download and conversion.
* Optimized Short Help: Re-engineered the -h/--short-help command to display version info and all available flags in a single, concise line for better readability.
v1.18p11:
* Implemented robust SIGINT (Ctrl+C) handling to instantly terminate subprocess trees (yt-dlp/ffmpeg) and prevent orphaned processes.
* Added automatic cleanup of incomplete/temporary files upon user abortion or conversion failure.
* Forced system stdout to reconfigure to 'utf-8' to ensure proper rendering of special characters in video titles.

Version: 1.17
Date: 09.12.2025
---------------------------------------
* Added --skip option: Enables skipping of files that already exist in the destination directory when processing a URL list.

Version: 1.0 (Original)
Date: 15.10.2025
---------------------------------------
* Initial release of the YouTube Audio Extractor.
* Support for high-quality MP3 extraction via yt-dlp and ffmpeg.
* Basic command-line interface for single URLs and list files.
